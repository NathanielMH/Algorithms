# Algorithms
Series of graph and tree algorithms coded in C++. Throughout this file, |V| will denote the amount of vertex of the graph and |E| the amount of edges.

## DFS (Depth First Search)
This is a search algorithm for graphs (directed or undirected). 
As it name suggests, given an initial vertex it explores the first path it encounters in full depth before moving to the next.
This is the opposite of what BFS does.
Complexity: linear in |V| + |E|, that is the size of 

## BFS (Breadth First Search)
This is again a search algorithm for graphs(directed or undirected).
Given an initial vertex, the algorithm epxlores the different paths from it in a layered search, that is it starts all possible paths and updates each path sequentially,
in layers.
